VPN Setup and Privacy Evaluation Report
üéØ Objective:
To understand how VPNs protect privacy and ensure secure online communication by setting up a VPN client, analyzing IP changes, and evaluating encrypted traffic behavior.

üõ† Tools Used:
VPN Client: ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
Verification Site: https://whatismyipaddress.com
Browser: Google Chrome

‚úÖ Steps Taken:
1. VPN Service Selection
Chose ProtonVPN, a reputable free VPN provider known for:
No-logs policy
AES-256 encryption
DNS leak protection

2. Installation
Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN client on my device.

3. Connection
Connected to the closest available VPN server (Netherlands server was chosen based on availability).

4. IP Verification
Before VPN: My real IP (India-based) was visible on whatsmyipaddress.com.
After VPN Activation: IP changed to one from the Netherlands, confirming successful masking.

5. Browsing & Encryption Check
Visited multiple websites (Google, Wikipedia, etc.)
All traffic was encrypted (checked via HTTPS and VPN tunnel)

6. Disconnection & Comparison
Disconnected from ProtonVPN
Rechecked IP and browsing speed:
With VPN: Slightly slower page loading (expected due to encryption overhead)
Without VPN: IP reverted to Indian ISP, faster browsing

üîí VPN Encryption & Privacy Features (Research Summary)
Feature	Description
AES-256 Encryption	Military-grade encryption that protects data in transit
No-logs Policy	Ensures VPN provider doesn't store browsing activity
IP Masking	Hides real IP, protecting identity and location
